<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to NsBm0d Page.</h3>

<p>This is my new Repo  NsBm0d  for Cydia formally known as <a href="https://NsBm0d.myrepospace.com/">NsBm0d.myrepospace</a> which no longer exist, I only do things with this Repo as a hobby and nothing more.  In this site I have tutorials and links that you can use. I no longer make cracked .deb files, but feel free to
install my Alist Tweak from Cydia to help you get anything you should want on Cydia for free. This pkg will install a list of reliable Sources that stays with the times as pkgs get updated.

<p>If you would like to learn how to create your own free Repository for Cydia you can use the tab above or my <a href="http://youtu.be/4goGcfcVrQ">tutorial</a> that will show you how using Mac. You will be shown everything from what you need and how to create a working Repository for Cydia on Mac. I have also created a pdf document that you can download from the Download .zip tab above to use as a reference that you can copy from along with working links. This will help you to setup up a basic Repo on Cydia but you can create a full scale repo site with all the bells and whistles if and when you know how. In this tutorial you will have all the necessary tools that you would need to create any Theme, Tweak, Mods, or Apps and package them into a .deb file and upload to your own Cydia Repository. Feel free to add my Repo if you like they are live on Cydia.

<p>This generic page generator it is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
